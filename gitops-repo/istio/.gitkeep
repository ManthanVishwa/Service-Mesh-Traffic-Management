# This directory contains Istio configurations automatically generated by the backend API
# Do not manually edit these files - they are managed by the Service Mesh Dashboard

# Files in this directory:
# - *-virtualservice.yaml - Traffic routing rules
# - *-destinationrule.yaml - Service subsets and traffic policies

# These files are automatically created/updated when you:
# 1. Create a traffic rule in the dashboard
# 2. Click "Apply & Deploy" on a traffic rule
# 3. The backend generates the Istio YAML and saves it here
# 4. ArgoCD detects the change and applies it to Kubernetes
